# Sys3.0   
Sys is a program for organizing your scripts that allows you to execute complex commands like ffmpeg without having to remember all the flags you need to pass.
It does sound like aliases, but i think it's more powerfull, or maybe that's just skill issues speakingðŸ«    
There have been 2 versions prior to this one, but some things best be forgotten.
